# D2Checkpoint.com

D2Checkpoint.com is a website that hosts checkpoints for raids and dungeons in the game Destiny 2. We provide a convenient way for players to pick up where they left off, so they can focus on completing challenging content without worrying about losing progress.

## Our Projects

- Website: The main website where players can upload and download checkpoint saves.
- Backend API: The API that powers the website and allows other tools to interact with it.
- Discord Bot: A bot that integrates with the Discord chat platform and allows players to manage their checkpoint saves without leaving the app.

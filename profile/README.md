# D2Checkpoint.com

D2Checkpoint.com is a website that hosts checkpoints for raids and dungeons in the game Destiny 2. We provide a convenient way for players to pick up popular checkpoints, so they can focus on completing content.

## Our Projects

- [Website](https://github.com/d2checkpoint-com/d2checkpoint.com): The main website where players can upload and download checkpoint saves.
- [Backend API](https://github.com/d2checkpoint-com/backend): The API that powers the website and allows other tools to interact with it.
- [Discord Bot](https://github.com/d2checkpoint-com/bot): A bot that integrates with the Discord chat platform and allows players to manage their checkpoint saves without leaving the app.

## Resources
